; COPYCHARSET
; To copy the character set from ROM to RAM.
; The active bank for VICII should be aligned with the destination address.
; This piece of code doesn't actualize the bank, just copy the chars.
; COPYCHAR_TEXTLOWVAR	:	Low byte of the address where the char set hay to be located.
; COPYCHAR_TEXTHIGHVAR	:	High byte of the address where the char set hay to be located.
; First of all the system has to be prepared to copy...
COPYCHARSET:                lda COPYCHAR_TEXTHIGHVAR

							lda #>$d000
							sta TEMP00_DATA
							lda #<$d000
							sta TEMP01_DATA
							lda $dc0e
							and #$fe
							sta $dc0e                       ; Interrupts are desactivated.
							lda $01
							and #$fb
							sta $01                         ; Charset ROM available for reading from CPU (char set id behind VICII/CIA1/CIA2 registers).

COPYCHARSET_LOOPPAGE:       lda (TEMP00_DATA),y             ; Read data from ROM...
							sta (COPYCHAR_TEXTLOWVAR),y     ; ...and copy them into RAM.

							lsr #$02                        ; Blocks of 1024 bytes (high byte determines the number of "256 block" so 4 times more is the number of the "1024 block" equivalent).
