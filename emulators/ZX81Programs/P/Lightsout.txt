Lights out by Tiger games.

An unofficial conversion by Andy Rea.

Started way back in april 2007, then lost
interest after a week or so.......

Until end of november 2007 with 2 weeks to go
so decided to finish it off kind of...

Theres supposed to be 100 levels but this 
version has only 40!

instructions are provided in game.

Have fun

Regards Andy
