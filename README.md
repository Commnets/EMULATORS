<b>Framework for Classic EMULATORS</b><br>
Develop By <b>Ignacio Cea Forni√©s</b>. Copyright (C) 2023.<br>
Used allowed under GPL license.<br>
The framework has been developed fully in C++ (version 20) using <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/es/vs/">Visual Studio Community 2022 (64bits)</a>.<br>
<br>
For better understanding of the framework unzip <b>html.zip</b>, included in the package.<br>
The package includes classes to develop you own emulator, including also assembler, compiler and consoles, remote and local ones.
<br>
The implementation of the framework for Commodore 64 has been included.<br>
In that case, the behaviour of the VICII has been emulated following the fantastic article by Christian Bauer that can be found at
<a href="http://www.zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/vic-ii.txt">Zimmers.net</a><br>
<br>
