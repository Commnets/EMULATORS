		  *	The VICII can be in either "idle" state or "screen" state... \n
		  *	In the idle state c and g accesses (code and color matrix and graphics data) takes place one, 
		  *	Whilest in the second one only access to $3fff memory takes place
		  *	(or $39ff when ECM = multicolor bit in register $d016 is set). \n
		  *	The screen state is set as soon as a bad condition comes. \n
		  *	The idle state is set at cycle 58 if RC == 7 and ther eis no bad condition. \n
		  * There are a couple of important things that happen as the raster line moves accross the line. \n
		  *	The rules to manipulate every value are decribed below attending to the cycle in the raster. \n
		  * There are 3 important registers within the VICII related with the graphics: \n
		  * VCBASE moves from 0 to 1000 (40 * 25) in a 40 step length. \n
		  * VC moves from 0 to 1000 1 by 1. \n
		  * Both will help to determine the position within the video matrix/color RAM to read. \n
		  * RC counts from 0 to 7 one by one and determines the line the graphics data RAM where to find the final info. \n
		  * RASTER LINE 0:			VCBASE is set to 0. \n
		  * RASTER LINE $30 - $f7: \n
		  *		CYCLE 14:			VC = VCBASE. If Bad Line => RC = 0 \n
		  *		CYCLES 15 - 54:		VC = VC + 1 \n
		  *		CYCLE 58:			if RC == 7 => VCBASE = VC; RC = RC + 1 \n
		  * So VC goes from 0 to 40 7 times before VBASE incrementes in 40,
		  * then 7 times more from 40 to 80 before VCBASE moves to 80 and so on and so forth.
